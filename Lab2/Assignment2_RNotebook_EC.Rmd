This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Data frame for this assignment:  lowbwt

1.	List the level of measurement for each of the following variables:

a. LOW: Ordinal-level
b. SMOKE: Ordinal-level
c. BWT: Interval-Ratio

2.	Show a frequency table and an appropriate graph for the variable Smoking Status During Pregnancy.

```{r}
table(lowbwt$SMOKE)
prop.table(table(lowbwt$SMOKE))
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
SmokePie <- ggplot(lowbwt, aes(x = factor(1), fill = factor(SMOKE))) +
 geom_bar(width = 1) + labs(title = "Lowbwt Smokers Tree Map")
SmokePie + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues")+
  theme_minimal()
```


3.	Describe the distribution of Smoking Status During Pregnancy.

```{r}
summary(lowbwt)
```


4.	Show a frequency table and an appropriate graph for the variable Low Birth Weight.

5.	Show summary statistics and an appropriate graph for Birth Weight in Grams(BWT).

6.  Describe the distribution of Birth Weight in Grams(BWT).

7.  Create a kernal density plot to describe the distribution of Birth Weight in Grams (BWT) for those who suffer from uterine irritability and then for those who do not. Try to use the code to overlay these plots on top of each other. Describe the pattern. The uterine irritablity variable  is called UI. Remember you need install and library packages ggplot2.packages before creating this kernal density plot. 

8.	Show a crosstab of Low Birth Weight BY Smoking Status During Pregnancy. Be sure to show and interpret the percentages (interpreting the column percenages is suffecient)

9.	Does there appear to be a relationship between Low Birth Weight and Smoking Status During Pregnancy? Uterine Irritability? Explain.

Submit to Canvas: your notebook. The notebook should include your code, the output and (importantly!) your interpretation of the findings.


Advanced material


#Here's an example of a density plot overlay which also shows the mean of two groups. Here I use the drug treatment dataset which we worked with last time. The example looks at the beck depression scale by site. Study participants were not randomized by site. In this example we show the mean on the plot itself. 

```{r}
#first lets read in the drug treatment dataset as we'll use that for the example. We will also need a new package called plyr. This is a very popular package and it is shown in the advanced examples from last lab

install.packages("plyr")
library(plyr)

drugtreatment$SITE <- factor(drugtreatment$SITE) # set site as factor rather than interval ratio variable

becsite <- ddply(drugtreatment, "SITE", summarise, grp.mean=mean(BECK))
head(becsite)

c<-ggplot(drugtreatment, aes(x=BECK, group=SITE, col=SITE)) +
  geom_density(size=1)+
  geom_vline(data=becsite, aes(xintercept=grp.mean, color=SITE),
             linetype="dashed", size=1)

c
```
