##Assignment 3
Create a New R Notebook and save it as both html format and PDF format. 

Data frame for this assignment:  lowbwt
**1.	List the level of measurement for each of the following variables:**

a.	LOW: Ordinal-level
b.	LWT (Weight in Pounds at the Last Menstrual Period): Interval-Ratio

**2.	Why is it NOT appropriate to create a crosstab using the two variables in the previous question?**

Since LOW is an ordinal-level variable, creating a crosstab using LOW as a variable against LWT, an interval-ratio variable, sums up the count for all binary values at that level, which is not useful information (see below).

```{r}
table(lowbwt$LWT,lowbwt$LOW, dnn = c("Lbs at LMP", "Low Weight Baby")) 
```
**3.	Recode the variable LWT into a new ordinal variable.**

```{r}
summary(lowbwt$LWT)
hist(lowbwt$LWT)
quantile(lowbwt$LWT,seq(0,1,0.05),na.rm=TRUE)
```
```{r}

lowbwt$LWTCat[lowbwt$LWT <= 100] <- 1
lowbwt$LWTCat[lowbwt$LWT > 100 & lowbwt$LWT <= 140] <- 2
lowbwt$LWTCat[lowbwt$LWT > 140] <- 3

lowbwt$LWTCat <- factor(lowbwt$LWTCat, labels=c('Low:<100 lbs', 'Average:101-140lbs', 'High:140+lbs'))
```

**4.	Show a frequency table of the new ordinal LWT variable (that you created in #3) and explain your coding scheme.**

```{r}
table(lowbwt$LWTCat,useNA ="ifany")
summary(lowbwt$LWT)
tapply(lowbwt$LWT, lowbwt$LWTCat, summary)
```
Coding scheme: Organized LWT into based on indications by 1st and 3rd quartile. Low weight below 100 (slightly below the first quartile), average weight between 100-140, and high weight above 140 (at the third quartile).

**5.	Show a crosstab of Low Birth Weight (LOW) BY Weight in Pounds at the Last Menstrual Period, making sure to use variables at the appropriate levels of measurement.**

```{r}
table(lowbwt$LOW, lowbwt$LWTCat, dnn = c("LOW", "LWT")) 
```


**6.	Does there appear to be a relationship between Low Birth Weight and Mother's weight in pounds at the last menstrual period? Explain.**

```{r}
prop.table(table(lowbwt$LWTCat, lowbwt$LOW, dnn = c("LWT", "LOW")), 2) 
```

There seems to be a slight relationship between LWT and LOW. 

Low LWT makes up 10% of non low-weight babies, Average LWT makes up 63% and High makes up 26.9%. 

This is compared to Low LWT's 18.6% share of low birth weight babies, Average LWT's 61% and High LWT's 20%. 

We can see that there is a slightly higher proportion of babies by low LWT among the low weight babies compared to non-low weight babies.

#Advanced material

Lets create a dummy variable based on a high level of gdp. As a reminder dummy variables are used very heavily in quantitative analysis. Better called "indicator variables" they use a binary coding scheme in which "1" indicates the presence of a characteristic and "0" the absense. First, lets look at the GDP variable to get a good definition of "high"

```{r}
summary(country$gdp)
hist(country$gdp)
```


The third quartile value is 7876 so lets go above that and call that "high". Here I am going to use "if/else" logic which is common in classical programming. Note how simple the code is.
```{r}
country$gdphigh <- ifelse(country$gdp>7876,1,0)
tapply(country$gdp, country$gdphigh, summary)
```

When you do things over and over in programming you should eventually get used to creating functions. Functions boil down repetive tasks to a couple of fundamental steps. It is always good to first "hard code" a process (like we did above) before generalizing to a functoin. When we create a function we have to name it something and specify the ingredients we are going to add to the function. Here I am calling the function dummygen2 and am supplying 4 ingredients which, for concision, I call elements a,b,c,d
a is the name of the dataset (in this example it is country)
b is the name of the variable I want to create (here it would be gdphigh)
c is the continous variable I want to create a dummy from (here gdp)
d is the threshold i want to set up for "high" (here it is 7876)
```{r}

dummygen2 <- function(a,b,c,d) {
  
  a[,b] <- ifelse(a[,c] >d,1,0)
  
return(a)
}

#Now I invoke the function
dummygen2(country,"gdphigh2","gdp",7876)->country
tapply(country$gdp, country$gdphigh2, summary)
```
Here is another way to create categorical variables
Here we will create various breakpoints and then use the cut function
```{r}
brks <- c(0,40,50,60,70, Inf)  	# Note: 1 
country$lifespan.range <- cut(country$lifem,
                          breaks=brks, include.lowest=T) 	# Note: 2 
summary(country$lifespan.range)
table(country$lifespan.range)
```
Here is a more general dummy variable functoin. This one replaces "na" with zero. Make sure that is what you want! There are no instances where this particular code would make sense with this dataset as there are no categorical source variables but you can use this with survey data which has a long of such variables. I don't actually apply this function here. 
```{r}

dummygen <- function(a,b,c,d) {
  
  a[,b] <- ifelse(a[,c] ==d,1,0)
  a[,b] <- ifelse(is.na(a[,b]) , 0, a[,b])
  return(a)
}
```


Missing values present many issues in data analysis. We'll be dealing with this in future labs.
Here is how you can visualize missings
```{r}
install.packages("VIM")
library(VIM)
missings_plot <- aggr(country, col=c('navyblue','red'), only.miss=TRUE, numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(country), gap=3, ylab=c("Histogram of missing data","Pattern"))
```

You can "fill in" missing values with the "mice" function. Here is how you would do that. I'll explain how this works in lab.  This will take care of most missings except for on some of the new factor variables which should be handled differently

```{r}
install.packages("mice")
library(mice)
set.seed(144) # random number generator
imputed_country = complete(mice(country))
missings_plot <- aggr(imputed_country, col=c('navyblue','red'), only.miss=TRUE, numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(imputed_country), gap=3, ylab=c("Histogram of missing data","Pattern"))
```
```
