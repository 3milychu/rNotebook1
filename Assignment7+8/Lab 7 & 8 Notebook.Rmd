### DATA: state_cor (Download it from Canvas)

##### 1. a. Pearon's R

Are Median family income and % of population with college degree correlated? 

```{r}
options(scipen=999) # get rid of scientific notation

cor(states_cor$MDFAMINC, states_cor$COLLGRAD, method="pearson", use="complete.obs")
cor.test(states_cor$MDFAMINC, states_cor$COLLGRAD) # give us the p - value, is it significant?
# What does R squared tell us?
CE <- cor(states_cor$MDFAMINC, states_cor$COLLGRAD, method="pearson", use="complete.obs")
CE^2 
```

61.42% of variation in median family income is explained by % of population with college degree. 

##### 1. b. Correlation Matrix

What if we want to look at correlations across all of the variables in the dataset? 

##### First we need to remove variables that do not have numeric values

```{r}
library(dplyr)

states_ce <- select(states_cor, -STATE, -REGION)
```

Or
```{r}
states_cor$STATE <- NULL
states_cor$REGION <- NULL
```

###### Now we can continue our analysis. First we name the correlation matrix.

```{r}
corrmatrix <- cor(states_ce, use="complete.obs")
View(corrmatrix)
```

##### 1. c. Correlation Matrix Visualization

```{r}
install.packages('corrplot')
library(corrplot)

corrplot(corrmatrix, method="circle") # corrmatrix is the name of the correlation matrix we created above

corrplot.mixed(corrmatrix, number.cex = 0.8, tl.cex = 0.6)
#number.cex changes the size of the number fonts. tl.cex changes the size of the labels

corrplot(corrmatrix, type="lower")
```

##### 2. Regression

General syntax: 

lm(y ~ x, data = the name of dataset) # simple regression. y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable. 

lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xk, data = dataset) # multiple regression. x1, x2..xk are all the independent variables.

##### 2. a. Unadjusted regression / Simple Regression

```{r}
regression_1 <- lm(MDFAMINC ~ COLLGRAD, data = states_cor)

#R default regression output:
summary(regression_1)
```

##### 2. b. Adjusted impact model / Multiple Regression
```{r}
regression_2 <- lm(MDFAMINC ~ COLLGRAD + URBAN + DENSITY + TEENMOM + DOCTORS + HSGRAD, data = states_cor)

#R default output:
summary(regression_2)
```

##### 2.c. standardized coefficients

general syntax

lm(scale(y) ~ scale(x1) + scale(x2) + ….scale(xk), data = dataset name) # y is the dependent variable and x1 ~ xk are all the independent variables.

```{r}
lm(scale(MDFAMINC) ~ scale(COLLGRAD) + scale(URBAN) + scale(DENSITY) + scale(TEENMOM) + scale(DOCTORS) + scale(HSGRAD), data = states_cor)

##standardized coefficients tell you which dependent variable is the strongest predictor, unstandardized tell you what is the unit increase/decrease in independent variable by dependent variable
```

##### Advanced: 2.d. 'sjPlot' and 'Stargazer' packages in showing a better format of the regression output

```{r}
install.packages("sjPlot")
install.packages("stargazer")

library(sjPlot)
library(stargazer)
```

```{r}
#Here is the unadjusted regression model output using the `sjPlot` package.

sjt.lm(regression_1, 
       show.header = TRUE,
       p.numeric = FALSE,
       show.se = TRUE,
       show.fstat = TRUE, 
       string.est = "Estimate",
       string.ci = "Conf. Int.",
       string.dv = "Unadjusted Regression Model",
       depvar.labels = c("Median family income"),
       pred.labels = c("% of population with college degree"))
```


```{r}
#Here is the adjusted regression model output using the `sjPlot` package
sjt.lm(regression_2, 
       show.header = TRUE,
       p.numeric = FALSE,
       show.se = TRUE,
       digits.se = 3,
       show.fstat = TRUE, 
       string.est = "Estimate",
       string.ci = "Conf. Int.",
       string.dv = "Adjusted Regression Model",
       depvar.labels = c("Median family income"),
       pred.labels = c("% of population with college degree", "% of population urban", "DensityPopulation per square mile",
                       "% of all births to teen moms", "Number of Drs per 100,000 population", "% of population with HS degree"))

##multiple regressions = use adjusted r^2( simple regression with only one independent variable = use r unadjusted - they will be the same)
```

```{r}
#3. Showing the unadjusted and adjusted regression results side by side

#stargazer package
stargazer(regression_1, regression_2, title="Regression Results", dep.var.labels=c("Median family income"), type="text")

#sjPlot package:
sjt.lm(regression_1, regression_2, 
       show.header = TRUE,
       p.numeric = FALSE,
       show.se = TRUE,
       digits.se = 3,
       show.fstat = TRUE, 
       group.pred = FALSE,
       string.est = "Estimate",
       string.ci = "Conf. Int.",
       string.dv = "Regression Results",
       depvar.labels = c("Unadjusted Regression Model", "Adjusted Regression Model"),
       pred.labels = c("% of population with college degree", "% of population urban", "DensityPopulation per square mile",
                       "% of all births to teen moms", "Number of Drs per 100,000 population", "% of population with HS degree"))

```

# Assignment

Data frame for this assignment:  empdat_cor (download from Canvas)


##### Part I Correlation

1.	What is the appropriate measure(s) of association/correlation for current salary and education? Why?

2.	Generate the appropriate measures(s) of association/correlation for current salary and education. Is the relationship significant? Why?

3.	Choose one of the three visualization plots to show the correlation matrix for all the variables in the dataset empdat_cor. Which two variables have the strongest correlation relationship? 

##### Part II Simple Regression

1.	Generate and interpret a simple regression model for the relationship between current salary and age. Using the ‘sjPlot’ package to show the regression output.

a.	Show your regression model output.
b.	How much variance in salary can be explained by age?
c.	Is age a significant predictor of salary? How do you know?
d.	If someone’s age increased by one year, by how much would you expect their salary to change?
e.	Is the model significant? Why?
f.	Speculate on the nature of the relationship between age and salary in this dataset.
 
Submit to Canvas: your answers to these questions AND the R code you used to get the answers.
